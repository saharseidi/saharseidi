### Hi there! I'm Sahar! ðŸ‘‹

My education is in Computer Engineering but I discovered AI in 2016 and fell in love with it! 
Since then, I have been working in the Data Science field and I've been trying to stay up to date with my AI knowledge. 

I work as a Data Scientist and a Machine Learning Engineer. 

I have created [this repository](https://github.com/saharseidi/Data_Science_Portfolio) to showcase some of my projects in the Machine Learning field.
